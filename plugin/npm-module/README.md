# Webpack Monitor
Webpack Monitor is a configurable Webpack plugin that captures relevant statistics on your production builds, and an interactive analysis tool that helps developers better understand bundle composition and identify and prioritize optimization strategies.

## Usage

![webpack monitor analysis tool](https://roachjc.github.io/main3.gif)

Install the webpack monitor plugin on your production config. The plugin will collect stats whenever meaningful changes to bundle composition have occurred. Optionally launch analysis too to see how your bundles have changed over time!

## Setup
```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-monitor
```

in `webpack.config.js`
```js
const WebpackMonitor = require('webpack-monitor');

// ...

plugins: [
  new WebpackMonitor({
    capture: true, // -> default 'true'
    target: '../monitor/myStatsStore.json', // default -> '../monitor/stats.json'
    launch: true, // -> default 'false'
    port: 3030, // default -> 8081
  }),
],
```

`capture` will collect stats on the build where meaningful changes have occured. We do not capture build data where the build does not differ from most recent build on file.  
`target` specify where to save your build data  
`launch` will fire up a local server and launch the webpack monitor analysis tool  
`port` optionally set the port for local server


## Standalone server
If you just want to display the stats, without having to rebuild your project, `webpack-monitor` publishes the `webpack-monitor` executable to just launch the server.

```
  Usage: webpack-monitor [options] [filename]

  Options:

    -V, --version     output the version number
    -p --port [port]  The port to run the server on (default: 8081)
    -f --filename     The json file to load stats from - Resolved relative to where the command is executed
    -h, --help        output usage information
```
